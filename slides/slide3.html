    Composition of an SPA Application

    In my experience, building SPA application results in large HTML files since the application consists of multiple pages and all of them are loaded together. Large HTML files can be difficult to understand and modify. I created functionality allowing to split SPAs into multiple files and load and assemble them all on the client. This functionality is also discussed here.
