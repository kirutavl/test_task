    What is Single Page Application (SPA)?

    Ordinary HTML applications/web-sites fetch each page from the server every time the user wants to go to a new page. SPA applications, however, bring all the pages of the application on the client's browser at the beginning and use JavaScript in order to switch between the pages making parts of HTML visible and invisible depending on which page is chosen. This makes the HTML application as responsive as a native or Silverlight application, since the navigation between the pages does not require a round trip to the server. This advantage comes at the expense of a higher application loading time. There are some ways to speed up the loading of an SPA application, making the SPA loading experience for the user the same as when loading a usual HTML application, but this topic is beyond this article.

    If you think of it, an SPA application is very similar to a Silverlight application, in that most Silverlight applications load all the pages at the beginning and later allow the users to navigate between the pages without calling the server. So understanding of the SPA concepts should come very naturally to Silverlight developers.
